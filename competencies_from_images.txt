The image does not contain a specific Competency number or title, or explicit sections labeled "Knowledge," "Skills," and "Attitudes." Instead, it provides several definitions pertinent to addiction counseling competencies. Below is the plain text extracted from the image:

---

**Addiction Counseling Competencies**

**Substance abuse** – a maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress such as failure to fulfill major role responsibilities or use in spite of physical hazards, legal problems, or interpersonal and social problems. (See also DSM-IV-TR for specific criteria.)

**Substance dependence** – the need for alcohol or a drug that results from the use of that substance. This need includes both mental and physical changes that make it difficult for individuals to control when they use the substance and how much they use. Psychological dependence occurs when individuals need the substance to feel good or normal or to function. Physical dependence occurs when the body adapts to the substance and needs increasing amounts to achieve the same effect or to function. (See also DSM-IV-TR for specific criteria.)

**Substance use** – consumption of low and/or infrequent doses of alcohol or drugs, sometimes called “experimental,” “casual,” “recreational,” or “social” use, such that consequences may be rare or minor.

**Systems theory** – view of behavior as an intergrate part of a larger social structure.

**Theory** – a framework to organize and integrate knowledge to facilitate answering the question, “why?”

**Transdisciplinary** – knowledge and attitudes that both transcend and are needed by all disciplines working with persons with substance use disorders.

**Transference** – the process in which a client’s strong feelings for significant others may be transferred to the counselor.

**Treatment barriers** – anything that hinders treatment. Examples include financial problems, language difficulties, ethnic and social attitudes, logistics (e.g., child care, transportation), and unhelpful patient behaviors (e.g., tardiness, missed appointments).

**Treatment goals** – objectives based on resolving problems identified during assessment and reasonably achievable in the active treatment phase.

**Treatment interventions** – strategies the counselor and other professionals use to assist the client in achieving treatment goals.

**Treatment objectives** – incremental steps a client takes in achieving treatment goals.

**Universal prevention** – prevention designed for everyone in the eligible population, both the general public and all members of specific eligible groups. Also, activities targeted to the general public or a whole population group that has not been identified on the basis of individual risk.

**Validity** – the degree to which an instrument or process measures what it is designed to measure.

The image provided does not contain detailed information on any specific competency including its number, title, and the Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes sections. Instead, it presents an introduction to the practice dimensions and lists the eight practice dimensions of addiction counseling. Below is the content formatted as plain text:

---

Section 2:
INTRODUCTION TO THE PRACTICE DIMENSIONS

THE PRACTICE DIMENSIONS
Professional practice for addiction counselors is based on eight practice dimensions, each of which is necessary for effective performance of the counseling role. Several of the practice dimensions are subdivided into elements. The dimensions identified, along with the competencies that support them, form the heart of this section of The Competencies.

THE EIGHT PRACTICE DIMENSIONS OF ADDICTION COUNSELING
I. Clinical Evaluation
   - Screening
   - Assessment
II. Treatment Planning
III. Referral
IV. Service Coordination
   - Implementing the Treatment Plan
   - Consulting
   - Continuing Assessment and Treatment Planning
V. Counseling
   - Individual Counseling
   - Group Counseling
   - Counseling Families, Couples, and Significant Others
VI. Client, Family, and Community Education
VII. Documentation
VIII. Professional and Ethical Responsibilities

A counselor’s success in carrying out a practice dimension depends on his or her ability to attain the competencies underlying that component. Each competency, in turn, depends on its own set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes. For an addiction counselor to be truly effective, he or she should possess the knowledge, skills, and attitudes associated with each competency that are consistent with the counselor’s training and professional responsibilities.

I'm unable to fulfill the request as there seems to be no Competency number, title, and related sections in this image. The page appears to be a glossary with definitions of various terms related to health and substance abuse. Here are the terms and their definitions:

- **Recovery** – achieving and sustaining a state of health in which the individual no longer engages in problem behavior or psychoactive substance use and is able to establish a lifestyle that embraces health and positive goals.
- **Regression** – a mechanism whereby an individual retreats to the use of early-life or less mature responses in attempting to cope with stress, fears, pain, or memories.
- **Relapse** – the return to a pattern of substance abuse or the process during which indicators appear before the client’s resumption of substance use.
- **Relapse prevention** – a variety of interventions designed to teach people with substance use disorders to cope more effectively and to overcome the stressors/triggers in their environments that may lead them back into drug use and dependence. The interventions can be placed in five categories: assessment procedures, insight/awareness raising techniques, coping skills training, cognitive strategies, and lifestyle modification.
- **Reliability** – the degree to which a measure is consistent.
- **Resilience** – the ability of an individual to cope with or overcome the negative effects of risk factors or to “bounce back” from a problem. This capability develops and changes over time, is enhanced by protective factors, and contributes to the maintenance or enhancement of health.
- **Risk factors** – conditions for a group, individual, or identified geographic area that increase the likelihood of a substance use problem or substance abuse.
- **Screening** – gathering and sorting of information used to determine whether an individual has a problem with substance use and, if so, whether a detailed clinical assessment is appropriate.
- **Selective preventive interventions** – activities targeted to individuals or a subgroup of the population whose risk of developing a disorder is significantly higher than average.
- **Self-determination** – the extent to which individuals control their lives.
- **Self-help group** – a supportive, educational, usually change-oriented mutual-help group that addresses a single life problem or condition shared by all members.
- **Service coordination** – the process of prioritizing, managing, and implementing activities in an individual’s treatment plan.
- **Significant others** – family member, sexual partner, and others on whom an individual is dependent for meeting all or part of his or her needs.
- **Sobriety** – the quality or condition of abstinence from psychoactive substance abuse supported by personal responsibility in recovery.
- **Special populations** – diverse groups of individuals sharing a particular characteristic, circumstance, or problem.
- **Spirituality** – a belief system that acknowledges and appreciates the influence in one’s life of a higher power or state of being.
- **Stage of change** – transtheoretical description of one of several stages through which a person passes in moving from active use to treatment and abstinence.
- **Stage of readiness** – the individual’s awareness of need to change. Can be influenced by external pressure (family, legal system, or employer) or internal pressure (physical health concerns).

**2005 Methodology**

The literature search for the 2005 update was conducted by the Center for Substance Abuse Research (CESAR). The literature search was for each of the four transdisciplinary foundations and each of the eight practice dimensions. It covered literature from 2000 to 2005. The literature search used the same methodology as the search conducted in 2000.

When CESAR completed the search, it provided the Committee with a list of citations and articles for each practice dimension. Committee members also recommended articles that were pertinent to a particular practice dimension. Each article received an independent review by two Committee members based on the following criteria:

• Relevance to the practice dimension being reviewed

• Relevance to another practice dimension or transdisciplinary foundation

• Contribution to further understanding of the practice dimension or transdisciplinary foundation.

The 2005 Committee followed the same methodology as the 2000 Committee in deciding whether to include or exclude articles from the practice dimension bibliographies. Group consensus focusing on creating a balanced representation of the available literature was used to determine whether to include or exclude books for the transdisciplinary foundation bibliographies. Articles and books selected by the 2005 update Committee were added to the bibliographies created by the 2000 update Committee.

- Assessment, treatment planning, and referral skills
- Working with various co-occurring mental disorders
- Group counseling skills
- Basic counseling microskills.

The researchers reported adequate internal consistency of the scale with a sample of 451 addiction counselors. Preliminary validity evidence for the scale was determined through two exploratory factor analyses, and the scale was found to be sensitive to counselor experience and degree levels.

```
INTRODUCTION
☙❧❧☙❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧ 

In 1998, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) published Addiction Counseling Competencies: The Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes of Professional Practice (The Competencies) as Technical Assistance Publication (TAP) 21. Developed by the National Curriculum Committee of the Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) Network, TAP 21 identifies 123 competencies that are essential to the effective practice of counseling for psychoactive substance use disorders. TAP 21 also presents the knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) counselors need to become fully proficient in each competency.

TAP 21 has been widely distributed by SAMSHA’s Public Engagement Platform (PEP) and the ATTC Network. It has become a benchmark by which curricula are developed and educational programs and professional standards are measured for the field of substance abuse treatment in the United States. In addition, it has been translated into several languages.

Because the ATTC Network is committed to technology transfer, after the initial publication of TAP 21, the National Curriculum Committee began exploring ways to enhance the document for future printings. Successful technology transfer requires more than presenting good information. It entails transmitting scientific knowledge in a way that makes it understandable, feasible to implement in a real-world setting, and supportable at a systematic level—in other words, getting the right information across in a way that makes it usable. The National Curriculum Committee examined how best to package and present TAP 21 to help people learn key elements and adopt new strategies. The result was a revision of TAP 21—a process that was begun in 2000, was completed in 2005, and resulted in the current publication.

HISTORY OF THE COMPETENCIES
In 1993 CSAT created a multidisciplinary network of 11 ATTC Regional Centers geographically dispersed across the United States and in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Since its inception, the ATTC Network has collaborated with diverse international, national, State, regional, and local partners from multiple disciplines to recruit qualified addiction treatment practitioners and enhance academic preparation and professional development opportunities in the substance abuse treatment field.

The National Curriculum Committee, composed of ATTC Directors, was established at the Network’s inaugural meeting. The committee’s initial charge was to collect and evaluate existing addiction educational and professional development curricula and establish future priorities for ATTC curriculum development. This effort led to researching existing practice and professional literature and defining an extensive list of addiction practice competencies determined to be essential to effective counseling for substance use disorders. These initial competencies would serve as benchmarks to guide future ATTC curriculum design, development, and evaluation.

Here is a plain text version of the existing content:

**Addiction Counseling Competencies**

The significance of TAP 21 for addiction counseling was that it provided a single frame of reference for curriculum development, student advising, professional development, and clinical supervision. The current updated edition of TAP 21 continues the work of furthering the professionalization of the addiction counseling field.

**Conclusions**

Although this is a study of perceptions and professional judgment and further inquiry is needed into the reasons for the discrepancies, these results suggest that clinical supervisors are getting far less than they need in entry-level counselors. More systematic discussions between clinical practitioners and faculty of training programs in addiction counseling should produce a redefinition of curricular goals based on the competencies described in this document.

Addiction counseling is a profession in the making. Rather than maintaining its professional culture by relying on tradition, addiction counseling is building its identity from the ground up, by first identifying competencies all addiction counselors are expected to possess. Such an approach addresses directly the “education–practice discontinuity” cited by Cavanaugh (1993) as one of the most critical problems in professional education.

Therefore, there is no information to extract concerning the competency number, title, or their corresponding Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes sections from the given image. 

However, I can transcribe what is visible in the image for your convenience:

---
**Appendix D – Complete Bibliography**

**Purposes**

This updated version of **The Competencies** includes bibliographies for each of the four transdisciplinary foundations and the eight practice dimensions. Bibliographies appear at the end of each section and are combined into a complete, alphabetized list here.

**The Competencies** bibliographies serve a number of purposes including the following:

- Serving as a guide to educators in teaching and curriculum development
- Offering assistance to counselors preparing for certification or licensure exams
- Contributing to practitioners' understanding and knowledge of research- and consensus-based practices
- Furnishing clinical supervisors with current reading suggestions for supervisees
- Providing counselors and other practitioners with a study resource
- Supplying administrators with current citations regarding the practice of addiction counseling for use in grant preparation.

**Literature Search Methodology**

 This updated version of **The Competencies** represents the work of two Committees. In 2000, a Committee began revising the 1998 version of **The Competencies**. In 2005, a second Committee was convened to review **The Competencies** and update the 2000 bibliography.

The bibliographies in **The Competencies** do not represent a complete reference list of meaningful addiction counseling-related citations. However, they are the result of a thoughtful and extensive literature review, and they represent the intent and spirit of **The Competencies**.

Both literature searches pointed up gaps in literature for several practice dimensions. A scarcity of citations was especially notable in the documentation; service coordination; client, family, and community education; and referral practice dimensions. Addiction counseling professionals might explore these subjects if they are looking for research and writing agendas.

**2000 Methodology**

The literature search for the 2000 update was conducted by members of the National Addiction Technology Transfer Center Curriculum Committee for each transdisciplinary foundation and practice dimension. Library facilities at Brown University, the State University of New York at Albany, the University of Iowa, the University of Missouri, and the University of Nevada–Reno were used. Criteria for the searches specified that resources be the following:

- Timely—no citation published before 1989 unless it was deemed seminal
- Empirically sound
- Relevant to a particular practice dimension and its associated knowledge, skills, and attitudes.

**Addiction Counseling Competencies**

counselors will be reimbursed for services provided. Addiction counselors who are currently certified with only a high school diploma may have difficulty making the leap to a master’s degree. Many addiction counselors may not be able to obtain the advanced education needed fast enough to survive in the market.

In 1993 the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) created the Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) Program to foster improvements in the preparation of addiction treatment professionals (Rohrer et al. 1996). As part of the ATTC Program, a National Curriculum Committee (the Committee) was established to evaluate existing curricula and to set priorities for current academic programs. At its first meeting, the Committee realized that the field had not defined the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that should be shared by all addiction counselors. Identifying and delineating these competencies became the Committee’s first task to professionalize the field.

Representing a range of specialties within the substance abuse treatment field, members of the Committee provided practice-related information through a brainstorming process. Once the general responsibilities of the field were identified, the Committee developed task statements for each. Committee members ordered the responsibilities and task statements in a learning sequence, based on the order in which responsibilities are generally performed on the job. The process of identifying responsibilities was considered complete when the Committee reached consensus regarding the accuracy and sequence of the task statements produced. The Committee identified four transdisciplinary foundations and eight practice dimensions encompassing 121 competencies. These results are consistent with the DACUM (Develop a Curriculum) process (Norton 1985), which typically results in 8 to 12 responsibilities and 50 to 200 tasks. The four transdisciplinary foundation categories were understanding addiction, treatment knowledge, application to practice, and professional readiness. The eight practice dimension categories were clinical evaluation; treatment planning; referral; case management; counseling; client, family, and community education; documentation; and professional and ethical responsibilities. Each category had between 3 and 20 competencies in it. This effort resulted in the publication of **Addiction Counselor Competencies** (Addiction Technology Transfer Centers 1995).

Although the Committee incorporated existing literature related to the work of addiction counselors, particularly the practice analysis conducted by Birch and Davis Corporation (1986) and the International Certification and Reciprocity Consortium Role Delineation Study (International Certification and Reciprocity Commission/Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse 1991) when developing the competencies that made up **Addiction Counselor Competencies**, it also relied on its own contributions. The Committee felt that job-related data provided a snapshot of what is, not what could be. And in the addiction counseling field, _what is_ has been questioned. Because of its peer counselor and personal experience history, treatment provided by some addiction counselors has been described as narrow and inflexible, impeding the adoption of new treatment methods that may better meet the needs of clients. Moreover, lacking traditional academic preparation, some counselors have difficulty understanding literature and incorporating new research results. Consequently, the Committee’s work emphasized moving the field forward. To gauge the potential value of the competencies, the Committee conducted a study to determine which of 121 competencies were perceived as necessary for practice by addiction counselors in the field.

**Addiction Counseling Competencies**

**RECOVERY BIBLIOGRAPHY**

In substance use disorders treatment, much attention is paid to what happens during acute episodes of treatment. There is often significant emphasis on treatment issues, such as treatment approach, therapeutic alliance, client retention, family involvement, cultural competency, and pharmacological intervention. The importance of the ongoing recovery process is sometimes not given sufficient attention. It is crucial to identify and address clients’ needs for case management, continuing care, housing, employment, transportation, education, life skills, social support—all the things that help clients reintegrate into the community, build a meaningful life, and sustain their recovery.

Here is the transcription of the provided text:

---

**METHOD**

The purposes of this study were the following:
- Validate a set of 121 competencies for the profession of addiction counseling
- Determine gaps between actual and needed competencies displayed by entry-level counselors
- Determine congruence among the perceptions of three practitioner groups.

The study was conducted in partnership with the ATTCs, CSAT, and the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory (Adams & Gallon 1997).

A survey was conducted in 16 States and Puerto Rico from November 1996 to January 1997. The survey instrument was distributed through the ATTCs to State-approved substance abuse treatment agencies. State authorities worked with ATTCs to select qualified treatment sites, distribute the surveys with appropriate cover letters from the State authority, and implement followup strategies to ensure an adequate return rate.

A random sample of 60 State-approved treatment facilities was selected in each participating State. For States with fewer than 60 qualifying facilities, all State-approved treatment facilities were included in the study, if the facilities were large enough to have a separate clinical supervisor who was not also an administrator in the facility.

Each treatment agency director was sent a cover letter and instructions, three copies of the 16-page survey listing 121 competencies, and corresponding postage-paid return envelopes. Directors were asked to distribute the surveys to a clinical supervisor, a least experienced counselor, and a most proficient counselor. “Least experienced” was defined as nonsupervisory, direct-care counselors having no more than 3 years of paid experience as an addiction treatment professional. Each respondent rated the level of proficiency “typically demonstrated” by entry-level counselors at the time of hire, as well as the level of competency “needed” at the time of hire. Each respondent was instructed to provide a rating for each item on a five-point scale, ranging from 1 (“very little to no knowledge/skill/attitude”) to 5 (“excellent knowledge/skill/ attitude”). Beginning 1 week following the due date of the responses, telephone calls were placed with nonresponding agencies, encouraging them to submit finished surveys. Final response rates varied by State, ranging from 25 percent in North Carolina to 82 percent in Maryland; the response rate nationally was 46 percent. The total number of respondents was 1,238.

**RESULTS**

Demographics. (See exhibits 1-6.) Respondents included 369 least experienced counselors, 412 most proficient counselors, and 457 clinical supervisors (N=1,238). Females outnumbered males in all respondent groups. The sample was mostly middle-aged, and age increased with level of experience. Seventy-five percent of the respondents were Caucasian, 14 percent African American, 7 percent Hispanic, and 4 percent filled other minority categories or were undeclared.

The respondents were well educated with 74 percent reporting bachelor’s or master’s degrees. As expected, clinical supervisors reported the greatest number of graduate degrees. Clinical supervisors and most experienced counselors reported the longest employment in the field (i.e., more than 5 years). Although “least experienced” was defined as no more than 3 years’ paid

I cannot identify a specific "Competency number" or "title" from the given image since it appears to be a textual description rather than a formatted list of competencies. However, the Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes sections can be identified if they were present in such a document. Here’s an extraction of plain text based on the document provided:

---

### Appendix C – National Validation Study

**Experience**: Many "least experienced" counselors reported more than 3 years of employment in the addiction profession. This may result from mistaken inclusion of other experiences in the field such as volunteer service, internships, or personal treatment and recovery. The least experienced counselors had the smallest proportion certified, whereas clinical supervisors had the highest proportion certified.

**Data reduction procedures**: Given the huge number of possible cross-tabulations with a survey this size, results have been summarized in three different ways. First, because the purpose of the study was to identify "essential" competencies, survey responses were collapsed into percentages of respondents rating each item "4" or "5" ("good" or "excellent"). Excluding the "moderate" ratings provides a more stringent standard for judging the content validity of the competencies. Second, results were provided for the national sample only. Third, responses were summarized across individual competencies within the 12 competency categories.

**Validation of the 121 competencies**: Internal consistency of the survey was high: Cronbach’s Alpha for the 12 sections of the survey ranged from 0.91 to 0.98. Among the clinical supervisors, 40 percent of respondents indicated that entering practitioners needed to be "good" or "excellent" in all 121 competencies; 60 percent gave these ratings for 118 of the 121 competencies; and 70 percent gave these ratings for 107 of the 121 competencies. Clearly, the surveyed competencies had high content validity for these experienced practitioners.

**Gaps between actual and needed competencies**: Large differences were found between perceived needed and actual proficiency across all three respondent groups. As exhibit 7 indicates, the gap was most pronounced among clinical supervisors. For all but 1 of the 12 items, less than half the supervisors rated actual proficiencies as "good" or "excellent." Exhibit 8 displays the percentage gaps for each of the 12 categories, as reported by clinical supervisors only. Gaps between actual and needed proficiencies are evident across categories, ranging from a 44-percent gap for the "Referral" category to a 54-percent gap for the "Counseling" category. Just as the perceived need for counselor competencies was consistently high, the perceived level of actual competencies was consistently low.

**Congruence among perceptions of counselor groups**: As exhibit 7 indicates, although the three counselor groups are consistent with one another in their ratings of need, they differ consistently in their ratings of actual proficiency. In each category, the lowest ratings were given by supervisors, followed by "most proficient" and then "least experienced" counselors. Differences between supervisors and least experienced counselors were lowest in the "Treatment Planning" category and greatest—not surprisingly—in the "Professional Readiness" category.

**Competency subsets**: Ratings of some subsets of the competencies indicate a need for further study. For example, supervisors and counselors seemed to undervalue competencies related to research and treatment outcome assessment. The Committee included these competencies because it felt that the counselors’ abilities to assess and monitor outcomes and apply research findings to their own practices were important and would contribute to the professionalization of the field.

In sum, this survey revealed large and consistent gaps between actual and needed competencies across all categories, with clinical supervisors perceiving the largest differences.

---

**Competency Number:** [Not provided]

**Title:** Addiction Counseling Competencies

**Knowledge:**
Counselors’ attitudes toward clients and the treatment process are important because they shape the therapeutic relationship that is at the core of treatment for substance use disorders. Negative counselor attitudes need to be considered within the framework of stigma and its consequences for the counselor, the client, and the field. Attitudes of treatment professionals toward the multiple systems of bureaucracy with which they interact—agency priorities, clinic hierarchies, the criminal justice system, departments of social services, community organizations—may also affect their ability to deliver effective treatment.

**Skills:** [Not Provided]

**Attitudes:**
- Exploring attitudes related to manual-guided therapy for substance abusers based on published studies.
- Understanding the impact of counselor biases and beliefs on the treatment of specific groups, including drug users and those with inhalant issues.
- Reviewing research on perceptions of supervisory relationships for recovering versus nonrecovering counselors.
- Investigating staff attitudes and retention in methadone maintenance programs.
- Considering the attitudes of counselors towards various patient populations including adolescents with sex offender issues and those in urban versus rural settings.
- Researching beliefs about confrontation in the context of client treatment.
- Studying the effect of staff beliefs on addiction treatment efficacy.
